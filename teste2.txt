Matching Named Variables
Named variables are irrefutable patterns that match any value, and weâ€™ve used them many times in the book. 
However, there is a complication when you use named variables in match expressions. 
Because match starts a new scope, variables declared as part of a pattern inside the match expression will shadow those with the same name outside 
the match construct, as is the case with all variables. In Listing 18-11, we declare a variable named x with the value Some(5) and a 
variable y with the value 10. We then create a match expression on the value x. Look at the patterns in the match arms and println! 
at the end, and try to figure out what the code will print before running this code or reading further.
